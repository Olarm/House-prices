## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data}
train <- read.csv(file="train.csv")
test <- read.csv(file="test.csv")
summary(train)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r heatmap, echo=FALSE}
train1 <- select(train, c(3, 7:12))
train_matrix <- data.matrix(train1)
heatmaply(
  train_matrix
)
```


```{r}
fit <- lm(SalePrice ~ OverallQual + OverallCond + LotArea + GrLivArea, data=train)
layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2))
plot(fit)
```
